CIS-7-Project

Case 1: Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel

Project Description
This project focuses on helping a solar marketing specialist travel efficiently between four cities: Riverside, Moreno Valley, Perris, and Hemet. The program calculates all possible travel routes, determines the distances for each route, and finds the shortest path.

Programming Approach
1.Graph Representation:
   - The distances between cities are stored in a matrix for quick access.

2.Route Calculation:
   - All possible travel routes are generated using permutations.
   - The distance for each route is calculated, including the return to the starting city.

3.Shortest Path:
   - The program identifies and displays the shortest route with its total distance.

4.Output:
   - The program displays the distance matrix, all routes with distances, and highlights the shortest path.

Instructions
1.Run the program:
   - Compile and run the program in any C++ environment.
2.View Output:
   - The program displays the distance matrix, all possible routes, and the shortest path.
3. Modify if Needed:
   - Change the distance matrix in the code to test with other cities or distances.

This program simplifies trip planning by calculating the most efficient routes between cities.
